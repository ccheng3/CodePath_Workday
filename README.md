1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) 
list them here.

StackOverflow    
Google - lots of Google.
Google probably knows more about me than my own twin brother does.  

W3Schools  
MDN  
Udemy Colt Steele Web Dev Bootcamp - I started a couple of Udemy courses this 
new year and just absolutely love how great the course quality is at reasonable prices too. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? 
How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I encountered a typical Javascript Web Dev challenge where I had written up the
code to play the respective button audio tone upon clicking on that button, but 
the expected outcome was not occurring. I felt frustrated at first, but then
decided to open up the Chrome Dev Tool and start stepping through the JS function
that calls the audio tone upon the button click. I added a typical
"console.log()" statement before the statement that I believed was causing the
error and the function was correctly logging the respective button number 
that was being clicked. 

I went back and checked the JS function, and soon realized that the error 
occurred when I labeled my button ID attributes differently than what the
tutorial did - I used a more concise label to "save time". Well, any time 
that was saved from that action was spent conducting this downstream
debugging process. 

I fixed the error and tested out the button click. It worked successfully!
I'm sure that this won't be the last time I'm in this situation but I'm glad
that I gained some more experience working with Javascript and the Dev Tool. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
(recommended 100 - 300 words)

I would love to learn about React and some of the in-demand web development skills. 
Will CodePath be hosting any Web Dev courses in the future? I would be absolutely
thrilled if CodePath can also organize a fireside chat with some current web/full-stack
developers. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing
(for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
(recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I spent some more time and implemented content from the Optional Steps 3 and 5.
Step 3 was pretty straight-forward - I added a small function that basically 
creates a new game pattern everytime the game is started up. 

Step 5 was quite enjoyable - I inserted images of some cartoon characters that are 
from my childhood shows into the buttons. 
I wanted to keep the color pattern so I specifically chose characters with 
that specific color (Pikachu is yellow, Beast Boy is green, Dory is blue, Blossom is Red).

A small detail that I would like to address, if time permits, is the small behavior of the
buttons physically dipping down the page upon being clicked on. I find it a bit
unsettling, but it is not too big of a problem, because I have also reasoned that
the user might actually appreciate this form of visual confirmation that the button
has been pressed. 

If I had some more time, I would definitely try and implement the other suggestions. 
They sound like extremely reasonable features for a Simon Says game.
